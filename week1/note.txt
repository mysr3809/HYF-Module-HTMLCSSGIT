1-How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

-For create hidden file we use touch command then we should write dot (.)beginning of the file name. For example>> touch .test.txt

-For create hidden folder we use mkdir command then we should write dot (.)beginning of the folder name. For example>> touch .test 

-If we want to display hidden file or folder, we use (ld -ls .?*) command group. It shows only hidden files or folders.



2-How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?


-For create multiple nested directories just in one line, we use (mkdir -p hack/your/future/amazing) command group. Initially Parent element is written first then children elements written in order.


3-How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

-we can append a message to a file with use (echo "message">>file name) command group.

For example;

echo first message>>note.txt
echo second message>>note.txt

But if we want to append a message and show them in same line we must use (echo -n â€œmessage">>file name).

For example;

echo first message>>note.txt
echo -n second message>>note.txt
